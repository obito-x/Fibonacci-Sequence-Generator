-About-


'This program is the generator of e(euler number) with nth decimal place like earlier program pi generator.'

Like Pi this also
:
advantage  : if you(user) enter other input instead of number , no effect on this program.

disadvantage: program output materials form is depend on the size of your(user's) terminal.

But don't worry. even the view is not clear , this program can work exactly
 
                
recommend: [ 81 x 24  ]
use this ratio on your terminal and run this program.
And view clearly.
    

    enjoy :)
